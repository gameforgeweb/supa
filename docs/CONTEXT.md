Create a modern, visually appealing GitHub page for my "Summer Supa" 4v4 Basketball Tournament. Use a clean, dynamic layout with vibrant colors (like orange and blue) to match the flyer. Include the following sections:  

1. **Title:** "Summer Supa - 4v4 Basketball Tournament"  
2. **Introduction:** Briefly explain that the tournament is a local 4v4 basketball event with a charitable component.  

3. **Tournament Details:**  
   - Format: 4v4  
   - Number of Teams: 8  
   - Entry Fee: $13 per player / $52 per team  
   - Total Income: $416  
   - Charity Donation (30%): $125  
   - Prize for Winning Team: $300  
   - Location: Neighborhood basketball court at **24950 Riding Center Drive, South Riding, VA 20152**  
   - Participants are responsible for their own water and snacks.  
   - Event Date: **June 17, 2025**  

4. **Style:**  
   - Match the flyerâ€™s aesthetic with bold, clean fonts (like the one used for "SUMMER SUPA").  
   - Use a basketball image similar to the flyer at the bottom.  
   - Add dynamic transitions and subtle animations.  
   - Use icons for sections (e.g., a trophy for the prize section, a basketball for the format).  
   - Display "$291*" in the bottom right corner as a subtle detail, similar to the flyer.  

5. **Contact Information:**  
   - Include the line:  
     "For more information, email: gameforgewebsites@gmail.com"  

Ensure the page is fully responsive for both desktop and mobile.
